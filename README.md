 Git Hub Transfer - Mini Challenge #8 Guess it
 This is a console project that allows the user to play a guessing game
 where the program generates a random number and the user has to guess it.

 The program allows me to choose a difficulty from easy medium hard and custom. I liked the responses given when I chose to choose an entry other than what was prompted. I also like the way the code is formatted, making it easy to read and find specific blocks of the code. Good job!
